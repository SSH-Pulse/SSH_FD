# SSH_FD# 

**SSH_FD** is a mixed traffic generation tool, specifically designed for the analysis of tunneled traffic. This repository provides the implementation of the proposed algorithm, along with utilities for feature extraction and dataset generation.

## 🚀 Features
The proposed mixed traffic generation algorithm takes each packet and its label as a whole during the traffic mixing process. The tunneled traffic generated by the proposed algorithm can be labeled at both the flow and packet levels. The packet-level label provides the label of each packet and the proportion of target traffic in the mixed flow. 

- Implementation of the mixed traffic generation algorithm as described in the paper.
- Utilities to generate tunneled mixed traffic.
- Outputs include mixed pcap files, packet length, time interval, and packet-level labels.
- Example configurations and usage scripts.

## 🚀 Dataset
We have established three tunnel datasets: Shadowsocks, Vmess, and Trojan, all of which employ encrypted encapsulation tunnels. By using the proposed algorithm to mix the traffic, we can obtain packet-level labels. The figure below shows the proportion of SSH traffic on the Trojan, Shadowsocks, and Vmess tunnel datasets.

- The mixed traffic dataset used in the paper, generated using the proposed algorithm, is in  `Numpy` format and can be accessed via the following [Download Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NMGLJ12LbhFJbVLc8550gjw-Y62RNNJH?usp=sharing)


## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSH-Pulse/MixTrafficGen.git
cd MixTrafficGen
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📝 Directory Structure

## 🛠 Usage

The primary script for merging and mixing pcap files is `pcap_mix_for.py`. It combines two pcap files, ensuring packets are merged based on their timestamp order, with special handling for SSH traffic.
